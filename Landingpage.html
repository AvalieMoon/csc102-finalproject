            <td>We got to either do something she suggested or one that we came up with. I decided to do one off of a suggestion through youtube. Although step by step was a bit harder to follow, It was a good experice.</td>
            <td>This was the hardest one to do, along with the username and password assignment. A lot of loops and correcting had to be done.
            <td>This assignment, I had to get a friends help who was already in the coding business, As they help give me tips and clarification. I wasn't able to get my original code script to work. But my second one was able to work well. Lot of trial and error.</td>

            <td>When working with a friend, it made the process more fun and enjoyable. Also not letting stress overwhlmed me as much within the project. </td>
